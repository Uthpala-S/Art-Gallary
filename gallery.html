                    <p> Mona Lisa, oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world's most famous painting. 
                        It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, 
                        where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century.</p>

                    <p>Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, 
                        France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor. While at the asylum,
                         he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.</p>

                        Girl with a Pearl Earring is Vermeer's most famous painting. It is not a portrait, but a 'tronie' – a painting of an imaginary figure.
                        Tronies depict a certain type or character; in this case a girl in exotic dress, wearing an oriental turban and an improbably large
                         pearl in her ear.</p>
